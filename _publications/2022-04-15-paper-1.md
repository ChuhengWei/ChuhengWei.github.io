Adaptive Cruise Control System (ACC) is an essential ADAS system for the autonomous vehicle for preventing all kinds of collision in the complex traffic and road situations. Ramp merging has been considered as one of the special traffic situations that can be used for testing the performance of ACC and sensor fusion requirements. To realise the project outcomes, the parametres of Long-Range Radar and Short-Range Radar has been implemented onto the IPG CarMaker with several scenarios of ramp merging been generated for simulating the ACC performance under different sensors and sensor fusion strategies. According to the simulation result, the stability of ACC performance under ramp merging needs to be permitted through adding sensor fusion between Long and Short Range Radar in order to prevent all kinds of collision between different dynamic models of ego and front target vehicle.
