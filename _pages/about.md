I am Chuheng Wei, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Transportation System Research (TSR) Group](https://www.cert.ucr.edu/transportation-systems-vehicle-infrastructure-interaction) within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Riverside. I am co-advised by [Dr. Matthew J. Barth](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~barth/?_gl=1%2Atxlm05%2A_ga%2AMTIxMTU1MDMyMy4xNjkzOTQ5OTQ0%2A_ga_S8BZQKWST2%2AMTcwMzkzMDI1My41Mi4xLjE3MDM5MzAzMDIuMC4wLjA.%2A_ga_Z1RGSBHBF7%2AMTcwMzkzMDI1My41Mi4xLjE3MDM5MzAzMDIuMC4wLjA.) and [Dr. Guoyuan Wu](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/guoyuanw). I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Smart Connected and Autonomous Vehicles at the University of Warwick, UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Valentina Donzella](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/about/our-people/profile?wmgid=1224).

My research focuses on autonomous driving perception and planning under challenging conditions. Specifically, I work on vision-based and multi-sensor fusion perception in adverse environments, cooperative perception in V2X systems, trajectory prediction and planning in complex traffic scenarios such as congested intersections and yellow-light dilemma zones, as well as personalized autonomous driving and vehicle re-identification.
