I am Chuheng Wei, a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Transportation System Research (TSR) Group](https://www.cert.ucr.edu/transportation-systems-vehicle-infrastructure-interaction) within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Riverside. I am co-advised by [Dr. Matthew J. Barth](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~barth/?_gl=1%2Atxlm05%2A_ga%2AMTIxMTU1MDMyMy4xNjkzOTQ5OTQ0%2A_ga_S8BZQKWST2%2AMTcwMzkzMDI1My41Mi4xLjE3MDM5MzAzMDIuMC4wLjA.%2A_ga_Z1RGSBHBF7%2AMTcwMzkzMDI1My41Mi4xLjE3MDM5MzAzMDIuMC4wLjA.) and [Dr. Guoyuan Wu](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/guoyuanw).

My research primarily focuses on the perception aspects of autonomous driving. This includes vehicle trajectory prediction, object detection, personalized driving models, and cooperative perception in V2I systems. I am deeply interested in how these technologies can enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles.

I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Digital Media Technology from Communication University of China under the guidance of Professor [Dr. Wenhui Zhang](https://ices.cuc.edu.cn/2019/1014/c5332a142078/pagem.htm). Following that, I completed my Master degree in Smart Connected and Autonomous Vehicles at the University of Warwick, UK, under the supervision of [Dr. Valentina Donzella](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/about/our-people/profile?wmgid=1224).
